  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  # storage :file
  # storage :fog

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:
  def store_dir
    "images/#{model.class.to_s.underscore}/#{mounted_as}/#{model.id}"
  end

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:
  def default_url
    "https://s3.amazonaws.com/oral-history/images/default.png"
  end
  
  # Process files as they are uploaded:
  process :resize_to_fit => [1024, 1024]
  process :convert => 'jpg'
  
  version :thumb do
    process :resize_to_fill  => [300, 300]
  end

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_white_list
    %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
  end

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
  #def filename
    #"#{rand(36**6).to_s(36)}.jpg" if original_filename
  #end
