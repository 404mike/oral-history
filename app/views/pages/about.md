# About

The New York Public Library's Community Oral History Project is an initiative taking place throughout the NYPL system that aims to document, celebrate, and make accessible the rich history of the city's unique neighborhoods by collecting the stories of people who have experienced it firsthand.  

## Background
Beginning in 2013 at Jefferson Market Library, The New York Public Library has been running the Community Oral History Project. This NYC initiative aims to document, preserve, and celebrate the rich history of the city's unique neighborhoods by collecting the stories of people who have experienced it firsthand. To date, more than one thousand stories have been collected by community volunteers. All recordings are available on this site and will be archived in the Library's [Irma and Paul Milstein Division of United States History, Local History and Genealogy](http://www.nypl.org/locations/divisions/milstein) research collection.
