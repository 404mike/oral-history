<h1>Improve Our Collection</h1>

<p>
  We believe publishing the Community Oral History audio on this website is the first step in a long, ongoing process of making these stories as accessible to the public as possible. Audio is hard to search, and thus, it is hard to discover the growing number of stories in this rich and diverse collection. With a combination of technology and community effort, we are developing ways to make these stories more accessible, searchable, and discoverable.

  This is a community effort. In order for audio to be made more accurately searchable, people and computers need to work together! We’ve created transcripts of over 1,000 stories from this collection using computer generated transcription services. Now, we’re inviting the public to correct these and make them more accessible for current and future generations of users.
