      <h1>Your Village, Your Story:</h1>
      <h3>Greenwich Village Oral History Project</h3>
      <p>
        This is a community-based oral history project at Jefferson Market Library that works to both preserve and document neighborhood history through 
        the stories of people who have experienced it.  
      </p>
      <p>
        From December 2013 - April 2014, trained volunteer interviewers worked to collect over 90 oral histories of people who have a longtime 
        relationship with Greenwich Village.  This collection represents the voices of individuals who have lived, worked or spent over 20 years in the neighborhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        We invite you to browse these oral histories - unedited interviews between Interviewers and Storytellers.  This collection can also be 
        found at The New York Public Library in a collection at Jefferson Market Library.
      </p>
